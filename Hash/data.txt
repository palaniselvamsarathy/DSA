If we have an array
and we havee millions of records our searching element is at the end
Then the iteration is too long...
Complexity - O(n)

If we are using hash map 
Complexity - O(1)

In python we don't have hash instead we have dictionary
[[[[ in Java we have hash and linkedhashmap ]]]]

prices = {
    'id':101,
    'name':'sarathy',
    'age':22,
    'salary':25000.00
}
