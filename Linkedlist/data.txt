Linkedlist

There are issue with arrays the linkedlist tries to solve
Issue:
If we have an array of 5 elements.. and we have a capacity to store in list of 5 items
and if we want to store anotherr element it allocates extra memory and swaps the value
Extra memory allocation 5*2  10*2 like this (already allocated memory * 2)

Solution:
The individual values are stored in different area of memory
but those are linked by these pointers. the pointers are reference to the next pointers address
Create like alinks here
through links we can access 

If we use linkedlist We don't have too swap the values while inserting
We just change the address and pointers of the value


Two Benefits:
1. No need to preallocate space
2. Insertion is Easy

***************
Double lInked list
-->. You not have only to link to the next element.. at the same time you have the link to the previous element as well.

Linkedlist have links with next element in the list
D Linked list have links at both side with next and previous element in the list
